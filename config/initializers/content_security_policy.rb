# Content security policy. Scripts are strict: 'self' plus a per-session
# nonce, no unsafe-inline — every inline <script> in the app is either ported
# to a Stimulus controller or carries an explicit nonce (the anti-FOUC theme
# bootstrap). Styles keep unsafe-inline for now: several views set runtime
# style attributes (progress widths) and Lexxy injects its own styles;
# tightening style-src needs those migrated to classes/custom properties.
#
# Note img-src allows remote https images because assistant markdown and
# crawled pages may legitimately embed them.
